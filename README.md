# üé≠ The Uncommitted

![main-page](documents/images/responsive.png.png)

üß† CodeConfident Quiz which is friendly reminder that you know more than you think!

This lighthearted coding quiz tackles imposter syndrome head-on by revealing a secret at the end: every answer was correct all along. Through bite-sized programming questions, we help developers:

üí° Challenge self-doubt with instant validation
üíª Reframe mistakes as learning opportunities
üöÄ Boost confidence with positive reinforcement

*"Wait... but I thought I was wrong?"* That's the point! Designed to mirror how imposter syndrome distorts our self-perception, this experience ends with a crucial reminder:

‚ú® "You had the right answers all along - trust your coding instincts!"

Perfect for developers feeling stuck in the "I'm not good enough" loop. Take the quiz, see the truth in the results, and walk away a little more confident in your skills.

# üßë‚Äçüíª User Experience Design(UX)
  ## The-Strategy-Plane
   üéØ Key UX Features
        1. Anxiety-Reducing Quiz Flow
          No Wrong Answers: All choices marked "correct" post-quiz (secret until end)

          Progress Visualization: Subtle "Question 2/5" counter (no % metrics)
          
  2. 3D Model Interaction
        Stress Relief: Draggable demon mask (symbolizing imposter syndrome)
        Visual Metaphor: Rotating/zooming represents "viewing doubts from all angles"
        Error Handling: Friendly retry button with emoji ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Üí üòä

        3. Confidence-Building Microcopy
        Affirmations: "You had it right all along" (end screen)

## The Surface Plane
 - ## Design
    - ### Colour Scheme
      - ![color-cheme](documents/images/color-scheme.png)
    - ### Typography
      - This font stack ("Segoe UI", Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif) represents a cross-platform system font combination designed to ensure consistent typography across operating systems while prioritizing readability
        - Segoe UI: Primary font for modern Windows systems (Windows 10/11, Microsoft apps)
        - Tahoma: Fallback for older Windows systems (Windows XP/7)
        - Geneva: macOS/Linux fallback (pre-installed on Apple systems)
        - Verdana: Universal web-safe font (installed on 99% of devices)
        - sans-serif: Generic fallback to the system's default sans-serif font
      - which is ideal for:
        - Technical documentation (clear hierarchy)
        - Open-source projects (works across all OSes)
        - Long-form content (prevents eye strain)
        - Minimalist designs (avoids flashy typography)

 - ## Technolgies
    - ### Languages
      - Django the primary language used to develop the server-side of the website.
      -	JS: the primary language used to develop interactive components of the website.
      -	HTML: the markup language used to create the website.
      -	CSS: the styling language used to style the website.

    - ### Other tools
      -	Git: the version control system used to manage the code.
      -	Pip: the package manager used to install the dependencies.
      -	GitHub: used to host the website's source code.
      -	Chrome DevTools: was used to debug the website.
      -	Font Awesome: was used to create the icons used on the website.
      -	Google: was used for random photos of children and teachers.
      -	BootStrap5: was used to create responsive elements.

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mbutler1991/the-uncommitted)
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
   - `git clone https://github.com/Mbutler1991/the-uncommitted`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)]()

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Mbutler1991/the-uncommitted)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

There are no major differences between the local (Gitpod) version and the deployed (GitHub Pages) version that I'm aware of.
